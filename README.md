# Quick Start ðŸš€

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build for development

```bash
parcel [path to index.html]
```

_By default path to index.html is 'src/index.html'_

```bash
parcel src/index.html
```

**Note:** If you do not have parcel installed globally, your terminal will tell you that the command 'parcel' is not found. If this is the case, simply follow the instructions on [how to install parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html)

### Run application in browser

Parcel will run a local server on port: 1234

Open the application in your browser

```
http://localhost:1234/
```
